Perfect — this will actually help you a LOT 👍
Below is a **completely different style of prompt** from the previous one.
This one is **modular, execution-driven, and system-thinking oriented**, not descriptive.

It is designed so **Google AI Studio (Gemini)** gives you **structured, usable code and architecture**, not vague explanations.
